## Make vs CMake vs IMake

## automake
* /Volumes/git/github/2024/docker_images/bison_helloworld_automake/
* for legacy gnu tools (CMake is more modern)
* Good to understand how all those projects are built

## CMake
* see /Volumes/git/github/2024/docker_images/bison_helloworld_cmake/src
* A build system generator, not a build system itself.
* Generates Makefiles, Ninja, or Visual Studio project files.
* Uses CMakeLists.txt files.
* Integrates with IDEs, compilers, and cross-platform projects.
* Cross-platform and widely adopted (especially in C++ and open source).
* Easier management of large codebases.


## IMake - obsolete
* Use cmake
* was used by x11
* I think objectivity used this for Cross Platform
