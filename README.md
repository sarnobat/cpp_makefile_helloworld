## Make vs CMake vs IMake

## CMake
* A build system generator, not a build system itself.
* Generates Makefiles, Ninja, or Visual Studio project files.
* Uses CMakeLists.txt files.
* Integrates with IDEs, compilers, and cross-platform projects.
* Cross-platform and widely adopted (especially in C++ and open source).
* Easier management of large codebases.


## IMake - obsolete
